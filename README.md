Researching CLI-based apps and contact management: 1 hour
Designing the program structure and flow: 1 hour
Developing the CLI interface and contact operations: 3 hours
Implementing file saving/loading with JSON: 2 hours
Testing input handling and edge cases: 1.5 hours
Writing basic documentation and demo script: 1.5 hours

Deliverables
Contact Book Python script (contact_book.py)
JSON file for saved contacts (contacts.json)
Sample test session recording or screenshots
Basic user guide (Markdown or Word format)
Code comments and structure explanation

Mock Data
Users: 1 (single-user app)
